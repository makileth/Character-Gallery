# 📸 Character Gallery

> Instagram for your D&D characters. Because "what does your character look like again?" is the most annoying question at the table.

## The Problem

Your barbarian got a sick new tattoo three sessions ago. Nobody remembers.

Your rogue changed their outfit after that heist. Everyone forgot.

Your wizard's pet familiar? Yeah, what color was that again?

**Sound familiar?**

## The Solution

Character Gallery turns every player character into their own Instagram profile. Upload images, share moments, show off your character's vibe. Your party will actually remember what everyone looks like. Revolutionary, right?
